    <h1>Dolphin</h1>
    <h2>Endangered</h2>
    <h3>Dolphins are one of the many endangered species of the world.
       <br> They are marine animals which means they live in the sea.<br/>
       The reason dolphins are endangered is because the sea is getting polluted.
       <br> You can help though! Don't throw your trash in the sea and help in <br/>
        charities. Even simplest things like that can help.
