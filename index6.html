    <h1>Sea Horse</h1>
    <h2>Endangered</h2>
    <h3>Sea horses also are usually thought to be safe but some species are very endangered.
       <br> They live in the sea.<br/>
       The reason sea horses are endangred is because they're lossing places to live.
       <br> Its harder to help this animal because we dont know much about the ocean.But not damaging oceans is a good start to helping this animal. <br/>
       Help in saving the enviroment and dont pollute the sea .It feels so good to help animals right?
